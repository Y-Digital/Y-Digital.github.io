The promise was evident but the delivery fell well short. The period came to be known as the (first?) A.I. winter. Thanks to rapid improvements in computing capability, abundance of data and a major paradigm shift in A.I. methodology the long winter is now behind us and the impact of A.I. on our daily lives is rapidly becoming manifest.</description></item><item><title>Why Digital Strategies Fail</title><link>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/why-digital-strategies-fail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 21:01:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/why-digital-strategies-fail/</guid><description>Digital technology has become an inextricable part of our lives and is rapidly changing our economy and businesses.
