How to scale unique human qualities**.** A few years ago I was working on a project to deliver a fully automated underwriting process. During this project the term RPA (Robotic Process Automation) came up as ‚Äòa revolutionary way to scale knowledge work‚Äô. In all honesty, I had to look up the term RPA as I was a bit intimidated by what it stood for but it turned out to be rather simple üòâ In the years after I have seen much confusion around the topic of scaling knowledge and what method (ML, RPA, Rule based or human insight) is best suited to the needs of a specific business process.</description></item><item><title>Alphabet Soup</title><link>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/alphabet-soup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 21:05:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/alphabet-soup/</guid><description>Until a few years ago computers were lousy at understanding concepts in text or dealing with complex decision criteria.
Opportunities through advances in NLP
Until a few years ago computers were lousy at understanding concepts in text or dealing with complex decision criteria. The capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) have, however, evolved rapidly over the last 10 years providing tangible opportunities to deliver real business value with NLP solutions.</description></item><item><title>Time to Shift the Paradigm</title><link>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/time-to-shift-the-paradigm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 21:03:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/time-to-shift-the-paradigm/</guid><description>In the late 90s the field of A.I. fell into disrepute. The promise was evident but the delivery fell well short. The period came to be known as the (first?) A.I. winter. Thanks to rapid improvements in computing capability, abundance of data and a major paradigm shift in A.I. methodology the long winter is now behind us and the impact of A.I. on our daily lives is rapidly becoming manifest.</description></item><item><title>Why Digital Strategies Fail</title><link>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/why-digital-strategies-fail/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 21:01:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/why-digital-strategies-fail/</guid><description>Digital technology has become an inextricable part of our lives and is rapidly changing our economy and businesses. Every company has developed a digital strategy but many experience difficulties in the execution. McKinsey investigated why so many digital strategies are failing. The article can be found here. A brief summary:

They should however have a broad holistic view of what digital really means for products and services, processes, business models, people and technology.</description></item><item><title>Ai in Law and Legal Practice</title><link>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/ai-in-law-and-legal-practice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jan 2020 20:57:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>/company/shared-knowledge/blog/ai-in-law-and-legal-practice/</guid><description>Artificial Intelligence has been applied in the juridical domain for several years now. Edgar Alan Rayo researched the current state of AI in legal and wrote an interesting article.
He breaks down AI‚Äôs current legal applications into the three categories: applications helping lawyers perform due diligence and research; applications providing additional insights and ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù through analytics; applications automating creative processes (including some writing) in legal work.
Based on the assessment of current players, he proposes six major categories:</description></item><item><title>Chapter VI: Esmeralda</title><link>/company/shared-knowledge/updates/update-6/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2017 11:25:05 -0400</pubDate><guid>/company/shared-knowledge/updates/update-6/</guid><description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description></item><item><title>Chapter V: Quasimodo</title><link>/company/shared-knowledge/updates/update-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:15:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>/company/shared-knowledge/updates/update-5/</guid><description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole‚Äôs idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description></item><item><title>Chapter IV:</title><link>/company/shared-knowledge/updates/update-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2017 11:14:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>/company/shared-knowledge/updates/update-4/</guid><description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox.

‚ÄúBegin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!‚Äù shrieked the people.

The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.</description></item><item><title>Approach</title><link>/approach/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/approach/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/contact/</guid><description/></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>/company/faq/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/company/faq/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Intelligent Document Processing</title><link>/solutions/intelligent-document-processing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/solutions/intelligent-document-processing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Services</title><link>/services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/services/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Vivamus elementum semper nisi</title><link>/solutions/conversational-ai/case-study-title/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/solutions/conversational-ai/case-study-title/</guid><description>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
