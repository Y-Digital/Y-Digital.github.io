  Chatbots and voicebots form integrated part of the customer contact strategy
  of today, yet, customer expectations remain low in relation to the much
  anticipated success of technologies in the field of unassisted customer
  contact. 


  Y.digital offers solutions that establish next-level customer contact, using
  technology that is capable of letting chatbots and voicebots respond to every
  customer query. Thus, using the customer’s whish as a starting point for the
  interaction. We use the latest AI technology, in the field of language
  processing and language understanding. 


  Our team consists of bright minds, experts in neurolinguistics and
  data-science. We apply a unique approach, for which is the course of a normal
  human-to-human dialogue. The technology should be supportive for users, both
  customer and employee. The use of advanced language technology makes customer
  contact more scalable, leads to more completed customer queries and more
  customer satisfaction. This way, we support employees in customer contact to
  answer really complex questions personally.


  The Ally platform is a SaaS solution, which can be configured for various
  applications, including as a Conversational AI platform. Ally supports
  customers and Customer Contact Centre employees by easily routing questions
  (by phone and chat) to the right department, handling customer requests, such
  as requesting, changing, or cancelling a certain service with the help of an
  intelligent voice assistant or chatbot. There are several ways to support
  employees in their daily tasks, think of the automated creation of a summary
  of a telephone call, the provision of the right information at the right time
  (Agent-Assist) and more generically, the analysis of automated customer
  contact, an overview of frequently asked questions and trend-analysis.

  - title: Customer Identification
    text: >-
      Customer identification is the process of verifying the identity of the
      person calling your contact centre. By checking the authorisation via
      Conversational AI, the assistant can prepare the call for the human agent.
      Or authorize the customer for self-service. This will save a huge amount
      of time without sacrifising customer satisfaction. Ally can verify a
      caller's identity through your CRM system using their phone number and
      personal details such as date of birth or postal code. Once the identity
      and intent of the caller are clear, the assistant can proceed to either
      fulfil or route the call.

  - title: Call Routing
    text: >-
      Based on the customer’s input, Ally connects the customer to the right
      department and even best agent for their unique question. This can be
      based on variables such as waiting times, a preference to talk to the same
      person they previously spoke to, or specific subject matter knowledge of
      the agent. No matter who the call is routed to, Ally is the ideal
      colleague and will always hand over the call with all information ready to
      go.

  - title: Call Handling
    text: >-
      Call Handling offers clients the ability to self-service, giving them the
      opportunity to solve problems on-demand; also outside office hours. By
      starting the conversation with the open question ‘How can I help you?’,
      clients can converse with Ally in a natural way. Call Handling thus
      reduces call volume and allows agents in contact centres to stop spending
      time on simple, repetitive questions. They can focus on more complex
      issues.

  - title: Registration
    text: >-
      The conversation registration feature summarizes a transcript of an
      ongoing discussion using an AI natural language model and in co-creation
      with the agent registers all information in your CRM system. Hereby, Ally
      determines the issue description and the resolution. Real-time
      summarisation solves the issue where a customer needs to repeat their
      query and other information when transferred from a voice assistant to an
      agent.

  - title: Agent Assist
    text: >-
      When Ally is ‘listening in’ on the call and summarising in real time, it
      can also suggest possible answers to the agent; even linking back to
      relevant parts of an instruction manual or knowledge base in your backend.
      Customers and human agents both benefit from this 'whisper' feature. For
      new employees, this reduces the need to learn lengthy company handbooks by
      heart – or frantically searching for the correct information while on the
      call. The consumer receives prompt, precise responses to their queries.
