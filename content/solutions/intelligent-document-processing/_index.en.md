    text: >-
      Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) is a smart solution for
      automatically processing documents with AI within your current business
      processes. Processing documents in an automated way is often difficult
      because of the sheer amount of domain-specific information required for
      correct treatment. The SaaS platform Ally assists you to easily categorize
      both structured and unstructured documents, analyze individual documents
      and extract text. An added Ally-platform cooperates with your existing
      IT-infrastructure, without any further modification needed. It enables,
      for instance, categorization and automatic processing of e-mails from
      customers, automated of the handling of insurance claims and the review of
      legal contracts with annotations and feedback. It implies deploying AI to
      support your business process, to better serve your customer and support
      your employee with the information necessary and applicable give the
      circumstances. This in turn will result in an improved customer
      experience, in rapid and relevant insight into the business process, and
      in an adequate and more consistent response to the customer.

      By using the latest language technologies, we enable customers to make
      information more accessible and obtainable and turn it into knowledge,
      able to interpret business rules and other ‘hidden’ business logic. Our
      toolkit uses a combination of different technologies, including cognitive
      machine learning, using optical character recognition (OCR) and computer
      vision. It extracts relevant information from PDF files, images,
      handwritten notes, signatures and plain text. Adding useful meta-data
      information it is able to categorize different documents, and to create a
      data set that can be used specifically for domain knowledge, document
      categorization, text interpretation and processing. All this using AI
      Technology as a tool towards empower employees and other users.
