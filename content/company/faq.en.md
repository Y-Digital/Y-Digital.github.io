intro_text: >-
  The tech business is constantly evolving, and new innovations appear on a
  regular basis. Adapting to changes means gaining all the necessary information
  about artificial intelligence (AI). As experts in the field, we would like to
  contribute to spreading the knowledge about AI by answering a set of questions
  that are frequently asked.
q_and_a:
  - question: What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
    answer: >-
      Artificial Intelligence are concepts and technologies that aim to enable
      computers to perform feats of human-like cognition. For Y.digital, core AI
      technologies include Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision,
      and Knowledge Graphs.
  - question: What is Natural Language Processing?
    answer: >-
      The goal of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to enable computers to
      interpret text and spoken language in the same manner that humans can.
      Example applications include document classification, machine translation,
      speech processing, and topic extraction.
  - question: What is Computer Vision?
    answer: >-
      Computer Vision is a collection of technologies aimed at allowing
      computers to process images and video. Example applications include object
      recognition, signature detection and recognition, and table recognition.
  - question: What are Knowledge Graphs?
    answer: >-
      Knowledge Graphs are a natural, machine-interpretable way to express
      knowledge about the world. This knowledge is represented as an
      interconnected web of attributes, relationships, and values. Knowledge can
      be automatically distilled from data collections such as texts (e.g. laws
      and regulations, rules, regulations, work instructions, professional
      articles, disciplinary law, texts in deeds and statements, etc.), or
      structured data sources.
  - question: What is Semantic Search?
    answer: >-
      Semantic Search helps users find relevant information in the
      ever-increasing amount of data available online or in a companyâ€™s internal
      repositories (e.g., SharePoint, OneDrive, FileShares, document management
      systems, email). Semantic Search relies on Natural Language Processing and
      Knowledge Graphs to go beyond literal matching, keyword-based search
      algorithms to unearth information that would otherwise be overlooked while
      avoiding clutter and irrelevant search results.
  - question: What is Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)?
    answer: >-
      IDP helps businesses increase operational efficiency and productivity by
      streamlining their knowledge-intensive processes (e.g. desk &
      dossier-based work). IDP can significantly reduce the burden on knowledge
      workers by providing them with decision support on large volumes of
      dossiers or documents. Additionally, IDP helps to improve compliance,
      consistency, and data security by relieving human workers of
      time-consuming manual tasks, hence increasing employee engagement.
  - question: What types of technologies are involved in IDP solutions?
    answer: >-
      Optical character recognition (OCR), Machine Learning (ML), Natural
      Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision are all part of a
      sophisticated IDP platform. It also employs AI components capable of
      analyzing both structured and unstructured data while continuously
      learning and increasing accuracy.
  - question: Is IDP scalable?
    answer: >-
      IDP is scalable because it can process as many documents as needed without
      becoming overwhelmed. Every day, you can handle millions, if not billions,
      of data points. IDP is the solution if your company has seasons with a
      higher need for document processing. It grows in conjunction with your
      business.
  - question: What is a Voice App?
    answer: >-
      A voice app is a voice-activated software that makes an organization
      accessible via, for example, the Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. The
      official term at Google is a Google Action, Amazon calls it a skill.
      Through a voice app, an organization gives the user the ability to
      communicate with the organization through the platforms of Google or
      Amazon.
  - question: What is a Google Action?
    answer: >-
      A Google Action is an application on the Google Assistant. With Google
      Action, organizations can integrate their products, services, news, or
      entertainment with the Google Assistant. Think of Google Actions from
      Bol.com, the Hypotheker, or Racoon.
  - question: Can you also use a voice assistant in a call center?
    answer: >-
      You can also use a voice assistant in your call center. We call this Smart
      Call Assistance. The customer can say what he is calling about in his own
      (natural) language, after which the voice assistant puts him through to
      the right department. Or he can give the correct answer himself, thus
      reducing waiting times. It also has a positive effect because waiting
      times shorten and the workload in the call center decreases.
  - question: What is Voice Search?
    answer: >-
      Voice Search is searching for information using voice commands. Through
      the voice channel, users can make searches using their voice. To get
      information through Voice Search, a voice assistant and a device is
      needed. These include Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, or Amazon's Alexa.
  - question: How does Voice Search work?
    answer: >-
      More and more users prefer speaking over typing when they enter a search
      query. This is called Voice Search. Google's algorithms then search for
      the best and fastest available answer. The top position is worth a lot
      here, especially since a voice assistant only gives one answer based on
      the search algorithm - this is particularly important for devices without
      a screen, like the Google Home or AirPods.
  - question: What is Voice Marketing?
    answer: >-
      Voice marketing is serving users or customers through the channel of voice
      by making information, products, services, and entertainment accessible to
      the voice channel. As an example, you can optimize your website for Voice
      Search and develop Google Actions.
  - question: How does my business get on the Google Assistant?
    answer: >-
      In order to make your business more discoverable on Google Assistant, you
      can do three things: First, create a Google My Business page. Then, make
      your website more findable by Voice Search and develop a Google Action.
      Lastly, you can, for instance, promote your company's products or services
      in an Action.
